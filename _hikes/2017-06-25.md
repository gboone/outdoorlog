Hike in Kaua'i with Krista and Ed! This hike is called one of the best hikes in the world for a reason. It's a moderate amount of elevation gain starting at sea level. The Hanakapi'ai Falls are incredible and well worth the hike. Wildlife seen: Sea turtles and rays (from atop the cliff), birds, fish.
