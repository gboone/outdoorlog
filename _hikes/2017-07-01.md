This might be the steepest hike we've ever done. The descent is pretty easy but can really hurt your knees if you aren't careful. The road is a public roadway and (contrary to what you might read) is paved albeit not well. Once down, the road leads to a Hawaii County Park. Most of the valley outside the park is private land. Wildlife seen: Wild horses, birds. The trail continues across the stream but we were ill prepared to cross.
