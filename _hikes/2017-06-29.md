"Base" here is actually the lowest point of the trail, the basin of the Kilauea Iki lava lake. Actual hike is probably closer to 4.25 because we lost GPS signal in the lava tube. (I mean, come on, it's 2017! I blame Trump.) Strava only reflects 3.75 because I forgot to start strava until about a quarter mile into the hike.
